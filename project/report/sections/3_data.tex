\section{Data Description \& Analysis}
% approx. 200-500 words
% The data used for training and evaluation your model.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textit{Dataset origin and composition}
%     \item \textit{Statistics (vocab len, number of examples, label distribution if any)}
% \end{itemize}
The dataset used to train and evaluate the model is word-level Penn Treebank, which is a variation of the original Penn Treebank dataset built to be best suited to language modelling settings. 

Specifically, the original Penn Treebank has undergone a pre-processing pipeline so that it features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item consistent lowercase;
    \item tokenization;
    \item no punctuation;
    \item proper nouns and other rare words have been encompassed by a \texttt{<unk>} token;
    \item digits have been replaced with a \texttt{N} token;
\end{itemize}
