This document is the final report for the course \emph{Natural Language Understanding}, held at the University of Trento in the A.Y.2021/2022. The goal of the project is to implement a language model based on LSTMs and to evaluate its performances on the word-level Penn Treebank dataset and achieve a perplexity score $\le 90.7$. In this work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item we analyzed the dataset;
    \item we implemented and trained a baseline LSTM model and a refined regularized LSTM model;
    \item we fine-tuned the refined model and improved it with additional regularization techniques from the literature;
    \item we evaluated the models and performed an in-depth analysis of the best performing model behaviour;
    \item we created a TUI application to easily interact with the model and use it to generate sentences.
\end{itemize}
The final model achieved a perplexity score of $79.86$ on the test set. The code for this project is available at \url{https://github.com/filippodaniotti/NLU-UniTN-2022}.
